# Safe WordPress Integration - Step by Step

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Installation Process**

### **Step 1: Test Button Generation** 
1. **Add only** the code from `wordpress-safe-step1.php` to your functions.php
2. **Save and check** - you should see a green message if you're an admin
3. **No automatic buttons yet** - just the function is loaded
4. **Test by adding** `[meal_planner_button]` to any recipe post manually

### **Step 2: Test Shortcode Method**
1. **If Step 1 works**, add the code from `wordpress-safe-step2.php`
2. **You should see a blue message** confirming shortcode is loaded
3. **Test by adding** `[meal_planner_button]` shortcode to any recipe post
4. **The button should appear** where you place the shortcode

### **Step 3: Automatic Insertion (Optional)**
1. **Only if Steps 1 & 2 work perfectly**, add code from `wordpress-safe-step3.php`
2. **Initially it does nothing** - you need to uncomment one line
3. **Uncomment this line**: `// add_filter('the_content', 'safe_automatic_meal_planner_insertion', 999);`
4. **Now buttons should appear automatically**

## üß™ **Testing Each Step:**

### **Step 1 Test:**
- Visit any recipe post as admin
- Look for **green box** in top-left corner
- Try shortcode `[meal_planner_button]` manually in a post

### **Step 2 Test:**
- Should see **blue box** confirming shortcode works
- Shortcode should generate working button

### **Step 3 Test:**
- Should see **purple box** 
- Uncomment the filter line
- Buttons should appear automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Features:**

1. **No automatic insertion initially** - you control when it activates
2. **Admin-only debug messages** - won't show to regular visitors  
3. **Conservative checks** - only runs where it should
4. **Easy to remove** - just delete the added code

## üîß **If Something Goes Wrong:**

1. **Remove the last code** you added
2. **Site should work normally** again
3. **Each step is independent** - removing one won't break others

## üì± **Manual Shortcode Usage:**

Add this shortcode anywhere in your posts:
```
[meal_planner_button]
```

Or for specific recipe:
```
[meal_planner_button recipe_id="123"]
```

This approach is **much safer** and lets you test each piece separately! üõ°Ô∏è
